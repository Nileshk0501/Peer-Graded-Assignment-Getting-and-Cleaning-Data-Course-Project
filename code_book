### Processing variables
Merged_data - it is the merge dataset of x_test, y_test, subject_test, x_train, y_train and subject_train datasets.

mrgd_test - it is the merged dataset of x_test, y_test and subject_test.

mrgd_train - it is the merged dataset of x_train, y_train and subject_train.

TidyData - it is the processed form of the Merged_data dataset after selecting only those columns that contains mean or std in theri names.
